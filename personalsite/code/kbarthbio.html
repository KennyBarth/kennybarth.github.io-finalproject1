                    A little bit about me:
                </p>
                <p class="biocontent">
                    I was born in West Chester, OH in 1995. &nbsp;Since I was a little kid, I have always been interested in computers and music.&nbsp;
                    When I was six I would try to design my own websites in Microsoft Word, just messing around with fonts and colors, which
                    laid the groundwork for a lifelong passion towards computers and design. &nbsp;My musical journey began when I was nine years old
                    and started playing trombone, but I was always interested in rock music. &nbsp;Then I picked up the guitar at age twelve
                    and fell in love. &nbsp;Since then I have played in four bands, and am currently one of the guitarists for the metal band
                    Starless, along with my brother Joe. &nbsp;Today I live in Covington, KY with my lovely girlfriend Vanna and our cats

                <p class="biocontent">
                    I started attending NKU as a Computer Science major in the spring of 2021.&nbsp; Since then I have had a blast learning Python,
                    HTML and CSS. &nbsp;I'm looking forward to learning JavaScript so I can take my web development skills to the next level.&nbsp;
                    Aside from web development I want to learn to design software.  &nbsp;I have ideas for plug-ins and different things that would
                    benefit musicians recording at home, and I'm excited to be able to implement these ideas.

                <p class="biocontent">
                    Starless was born from the ashes of our old project Airways, which went through a lot of lineup changes, played a couple 
                    shows and wrote a few songs but never really got off the ground. &nbsp;The main constants in that band were me, Joe and Dylan 
                    and in 2018 we got Wally on board as a vocalist and Ethan in on drums for the new project. &nbsp;At that point, everything clicked that 
                    hadnâ€™t clicked with any of the original lineups, so we decided to rebrand, write new songs and Starless was born.&nbsp;
                    Today, we've released one EP and two singles and have played several great shows with bands like Hollow Front, Wolves 
                    at the Gate and more.  &nbsp;We're currently working on our second EP and have some cool shows planned for the fall!
